<h1 style="text-align: center;">Point of Sale (POS) System </h1>

A **Point of Sale (POS) system** consists of both hardware and software that enables businesses to handle sales transactions. It usually features a register, a card reader, and software that manages sales, inventory, and customer information. POS systems are applicable in a range of environments, such as retail shops, restaurants, and service-oriented businesses. They are crucial for businesses to manage sales transactions, monitor inventory, and enhance operational efficiency.

## Introduction

This Python project simulates the software used in handling sales transactions of a product, specifically for the use in restaurants. The code utilizes a `POSsystem` class to easily and efficiently handle the adding and removing of items, calculation of cost, and the generating of sales invoice. This project is implemented using Python and the Tkinter GUI library for a simple and intuitive user experience.

## Code Overview

-  `__init__()`: This method initializes the required attributes for the POS system.
- `create_widgets()`: This method sets up the interface the users will interact with.
- `add_menu()`: This method adds the menu item selected by the user and updates the corresponding displays accordingly.
- `add_bills()`: This method adds the bill selected by the user and updates the corresponding displays accordingly.
- `calculate_changes()`: This method calculates the change that the customer should receive.
- `cancel()`: This method sends a signal to cancel the entire transaction process, resetting the interface to its original state.
- `clear()`: This method sends a signal to remove the last selected item or bill chosen by the user.
- `submit()`: This method sends a signal to process the transaction order. Ensure orders are finalized and customer has given a mode of payment.
- `payment_mode()`: This method selects the mode of payment, which can be either cash or card, as specified by the customer.
- `display_orders()`: This method is called when necessary to update the display that shows the items ordered by the customer.
- `display_total()`: This method is called when necessary to update the display that shows the total cost of all items ordered by the customer.
- `display_error()`: This method is called when there is a need to update the display to show any errors encountered while using the POS system.
- `generate_id()`: This method generates a unique 6-character ID.
- `generate_sales_invoice()`: This method generates the sales invoice for each transaction.
- `write_to_file()`: This method writes the generated sales invoice to a json file.

```python
import string
import random
import json
import os

from tkinter import *
from datetime import datetime
from menu import menu_items
from bills import bills

class POSsystem:
	def __init__(self, window):
        pass
		
	def create_widgets(self):
        pass
		
	def add_menu(self, item: dict):

        pass
		
	def write_to_file(self, transaction):
        pass

	window = Tk()
	pos_system = POSsystem(window)
	window.mainloop()

```

## Features

- **User-friendly Design:** The app features a simple and intuitive interface design that enhances the user's experience by allowing for effortless navigation and quick access to essential features.
- **After-Tax Calculation:** Realistically replicates real-world situations by incorporating a 7% Goods and Services Tax (GST) into the overall cost.
- **Unique ID Reference:** Generates a 6-character unique identifier for every transaction, which enables the owner to monitor and record every transaction made with precision and accuracy.
- **Sales Invoice:** Generates a comprehensive sales invoice that includes the date and time of the transaction, the subtotal and total cost of items, the applicable tax percentage, and a detailed list of all items ordered.
- **Multiple Payment Options:** Easily toggle between cash or card payment.
- **Backup JSON File:** A backup copy of all sales invoices is maintained in JSON format, enabling easy access and retrieval of the data whenever needed.

## How to Use

Here are the guidelines for installing and using the POS system:

### Requirements

- Python 3.x

### Installation & Usage

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/klaus-001/pos-system-gui.git`
2. Navigate to the directory: `cd "DIRECTORY NAME"`
3. Run the script: `python main.py`

## Project Structure

### [main.py](main.py)

The file contains the `POSsystem` class, which is responsible for managing customer orders. It includes functionalities for adding and removing orders, calculating the total cost of an order and the expected change for the customer, as well as generating a sales invoice for each transaction. It also includes the main loop that executes the application.

### [menu.py](menu.py)

The file contains a list of dictionaries that outlines the menu items utilized in the POS system. Each entry contains a code, name of the food item, and its cost.

### [bills.py](bills.py)

The file contains a list of dictionaries that outlines the bills utilized in the POS system. Each entry contains the code (10Â¢, $1, $50) and its equivalent value.

### [sales_record.json](sales_record.json)

The file contains a copy of every transaction stored in JSON format.

## Possible Improvements

1. Add a database to store all transaction details.
2. Chage the labels **F1-F9** to the name of the food items or add a way for the user to identify which food item is behind which label (e.g. creating a pop-up message).
3. The POS system is currently only capable of storing 9 food items, we can add a menu bar to the project to allow changes from foods only to also drinks, desserts, and etc.

This project is far from perfect and there are numerous ways to improve it. Contributions are encouraged, please feel free to make useful changes to the project.
